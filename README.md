## Intruction
 
 The project consists in being able to animate your GIF in ASCII Art directly from the CMD
 
 Here is an example :

## Installation 

**To install it is very simple, you just have to follow the instructions below.**

## Step 1

- To start, you must have python on your computer
	Here is a link to help you install python :

## Step 2

- Then you have to install the requirements :
	 `pip install -r requirements.txt
	 or
	 pip install colorama`

<p align="center">ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³__And yes the installation is already finished, I told you it was simple__ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³</p>	

## How to use 
- Go to the folder you wanted to upload. For example, in the video, it is "Banana Dancing"

- Once in the folder, click on the bar above and type `Cmd`

- This will open a cmd, in the cmd type `python banane.py`

	ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³__That's it, you have successfully launched the program!__ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

## How to create your own animation 

## Step 1 

- To start, create a new folder with the name of your creation 
	*Exemple :*

- Then copy and paste the file main.py into your, and replace the name with the name of your creation 

## Step 2

- You need a .gif image

- Then you have to decompose the GIF.  
	I recommend this site : https://www.bloggif.com/gif-extract

## Step 3

- Once the GIF is decomposed, you need to convert all the images to ASCII-ART
	I recommend this site : https://www.text-image.com/convert/ascii.html

![ascii](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107991103/183254195-04055b00-9e37-4379-ad77-622b48ba7f45.PNG)

<p align="center">__There is surely a faster or better method so it's up to you to look.__ </p>

## Step 4

- Once you have all your ASCII (Frame) :
	*Exemple :*
	
	![Frame](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107991103/183255123-9020cfa8-c53c-4da6-8ca2-ea6f8dd48407.PNG)

- Put all your frames in the folder you created
	
	You should end up with this :

## Step 5

- Open the python file :

- Put the name of your frames in "Name_File.txt" :

<p align="center">
  ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³__Now all you have to do is save, close and finally launch as seen above __ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
</p>
